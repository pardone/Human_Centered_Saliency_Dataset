# Human_Centered_Saliency_Dataset
Two datasets for human centered saliency detection

1) HumanCentered Dataset. We collect a number of 3D models adaptable to our agents from internet. Our dataset is made up of 300 mesh
models, subdivided into 6 classes, each of which contains 50 objects. The six classes are bed, cabinet, chair, desk, sofa, and
tea table, which are not only commonly seen in an indoor scene but also frequently used by a human. Shapes in each class contain
sufficient and diverse variation from geometrical change to topological variability in the same semantic group. It can be
seen that the dataset is challenging for saliency detection. We assume that all the 3D models are placed upright in advance.

2) SHREC 2014 Dataset. To test our approach on an exist big database, we chose SHREC 2014 as the source database. They are with large
geometrical and topological variations. We selected the corresponding six kinds of model from this database and form a new subset. 
The new database contains about 2000 models.
